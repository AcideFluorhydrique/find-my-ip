### What is this?

Find My IP is a straightforward Android app designed to fetch and optionally store your current IP
address, helping you keep a history of your IP addresses. It can automatically log IP changes in the
background, so you don't have to open the app every time.

    <img src="./metadata/en-US/images/phoneScreenshots/history_disabled.png" width="30%"/>

</div>

### How does it work?

The application uses the [`api.ipify.org`](https://api.ipify.org) API to get the IP address of the
device.

### Why does it exist?

I needed a simple way to get my IP address history on my phone, so I made this app.
